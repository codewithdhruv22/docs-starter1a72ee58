# Introduction

Welcome to our project! This comprehensive system, developed by Code With Dhruv, streamlines the management of orders and payments for BhagyaLaxmi Dairy. Leveraging modern technologies like Firebase, Flask, and Flutter, our system revolutionizes the process of order placement, payment handling, and order tracking. With features such as real-time updates, secure authentication, and seamless integration with hardware peripherals like printers, it offers a user-friendly experience for both customers and staff. Let's delve into how this project enhances operational efficiency and customer service in the dairy industry.

## Implementation Details and Customizations

### Changing RazorPay API (cart_page.dart)

To update the RazorPay API details, navigate to the `cart_page.dart` file and locate the `startPayment()` function. Modify the options object as follows:

```dart
void startPayment() {
    var options = {
      'key': 'rzp_live_Zt7uyicSURwINp',
      'amount': totalPrice * 100, // amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 2000 paise = â‚¹20)
      'name': 'BhagyaLaxmi Dairy',
      'description': 'Payment For ',
      // 'prefill': {'contact': "86545789"}
    };
```

# Adding More Products (shop_page.dart)

To include additional products, open the `shop_page.dart` file and add them to the `chat_products` list. Here's an example:

```dart
List<Product> chat_products = [
    Product(
      name: "SHEV PURI",
      price: 30,
      qty: 0,
      imagePath: "assets/product_image/shevpuri.png",
    ),
```

# Changing the Token Length (cart_page.dart)

To adjust the token length, modify the `generateRandomNumber()` function in the `cart_page.dart` file:

```dart
int generateRandomNumber() { 
    Random random = new Random(); 
    int min = 100000; // minimum 6-digit number 
    int max = 999999; // maximum 6-digit number 
    return min + random.nextInt(max - min); 
} 
```

# Finding Printer Name

To find the printer name, follow these steps:

1. Open Device Manager.

2. Locate your printer in the list.

Once you have found your printer, add its name to the printer_name list. Note that the printer name is case-sensitive in the code.


# Adding Printer Name (main.py)

To specify the printer name, update the `printer_name` variable in the `main.py` file:

```python
printer_name = ["POS-80C"]
```


# Changing Admin Panel PIN (main.py)

To modify the admin panel PIN, update the `VALID_PASSWORD` variable in the `main.py` file:

```python
VALID_PASSWORD = "123456"
```

# Changing Notification Sound (main.html)

To update the notification sound, modify the `audio` variable in the `main.html` file:

```html
var audio = new Audio('/static/light-hearted-message-tone.mp3');
```
